# AstroLocalization Toolkit

AstroLocalization Toolkit is a specialized software solution that leverages celestial observations for accurate location determination. Designed for applications in celestial navigation, space research, and location-based services, this toolkit combines the power of astronomy, mathematics, and modern technology to provide precise localization even in GPS-denied environments.

## Features

- **Image-Based Localization:** Upload an image of the night sky, and our toolkit will analyze the celestial objects present to determine your geographic location.

- **Real-Time Sensor Integration:** For enhanced accuracy, integrate data from onboard sensors like accelerometers and gyroscopes to account for motion and orientation.

- **Extensive Celestial Data:** Utilize a comprehensive star catalog and ephemeris data to accurately identify celestial objects in the uploaded images.

- **Simple API Interface:** Communicate with the toolkit through a straightforward RESTful API, making it easy to integrate into your applications.

- **Highly Configurable:** Customize localization algorithms, celestial object databases, and sensor integration to suit your specific needs.
